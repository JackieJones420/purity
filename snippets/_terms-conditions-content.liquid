    <p>Under the Program, you earn five (5) Purist Perk points (“point”) for every U.S. dollar spent on merchandise in the United States online, or in a 100% PURE® retail store.</p>
    <p>Subject to the Termination provision of these Terms, points will expire if there is no account activity in 12 calendar months. Points may be redeemed for rewards (“Perks”) to be determined by 100% PURE® in its sole discretion; provided, however, that in order to redeem your points for any Reward, you must (1) accumulate a minimum number of points as established by 100% PURE® and (2) make an additional purchase of merchandise from 100% PURE® at the time that you redeem your points. Program members are able to redeem no more than one of each Perk per transaction. Program members cannot redeem more than 10 of any one unique Perk sku per year. Points have no cash value and can only be redeemed for Perks. 100% PURE® may, in its discretion, allow points to be redeemable for other items of merchandise from time to time. However, points are never redeemable for cash.</p>
    <p>Perks are available with point redemption while supplies last and substitutions by 100% PURE® may occur. You are not required to redeem a Perk during checkout. Due to the limited nature of the free deluxe Perks, we regret that we are unable to reship Perks if they arrive damaged, if you received the wrong one or if one is missing from your order. In the event a Perk arrives damaged, you received the wrong one, or one is missing from your order, please contact 100% PURE® customer service or visit your local 100% PURE® store.</p>

    <p>In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and 100% PURE® agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to use of this Site or the purchase of any 100% PURE® product from this Site (referred to as a “Claim”) will be resolved as follows:</p>

Please send a written notice describing the dispute to: <a class="thin-u-l" href="mailto:complaints@puritycosmetics.com">complaints@puritycosmetics.com</a></p>

        <p>Formal Resolution by Arbitration/Class Action Waiver:</p>
        <p><strong>READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION.</strong>You agree that any dispute, controversy or Claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the applicability of these Terms as to the use of any 100% PURE® Site, or the purchase of any 100% PURE® products from this Site, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms, or the determination of the scope or applicability of Arbitration shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
        <p>If you and 100% PURE® cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim asserted by either party will be resolved only by binding Arbitration. By agreeing to Arbitration, both you and 100% PURE® understand and agree that all disputes shall be decided by an arbitrator and that you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes.  Instead of suing in court, both you and 100% PURE® each agree to settle disputes (except certain small claims) only by Arbitration. <strong>ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>. The rules in Arbitration are different.  There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms as a court would.</p>
        <p>The Arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. You may, in Arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state. If you decide to initiate Arbitration, 100% PURE® agrees to pay the Arbitration initiation fee and any additional required deposit required by JAMS to initiate your Arbitration. You and 100% PURE® agree to pay the costs of the Arbitration proceeding provided however that if you are a consumer you shall not be required to pay more than $250.00 of the fees or such amount as the JAMS Rules may later prescribe. All other fees, such as attorneys’ fees and expenses of travel to the Arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The Arbitration will be held at a location in your home town area if possible, unless you and 100% PURE® both agree to another location or telephonic Arbitration. To initiate Arbitration, you or 100% PURE® must do the following things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at <a class="thin-u-l" href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>.</li>
          <li>Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS [to your local JAMS office] or to JAMS, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 1400, Los Angeles, CA 90067.</li>
          <li>Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Special Rules in the Arbitration Proceeding. (i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor 100% PURE® shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in Arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. <strong>THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER.</strong> Accordingly, you and 100% PURE® agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our Arbitration. A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable. Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all Claims under these Terms, you may assert an individual Claim in small claims court in lieu of Arbitration.
